This project transforms a pair of stereo images into a 3 dimensional model. This model is then converted into a cube representation


Project Done Using:
Python 3.7.0
	Libraries:
		OpenCV 2
		Open3d
Processing 2.0


Files:

calibrateCamera.py 
	Contains code to find calibration information for the camera

disparityMap.py
	Main code to generate the 3 dimensional model from stereo images using depth map

generateMap.py
	Code to generate 3 dimensional model from images captured by a phone
	Note: Depth map doesnt work with current set of images

convertToModel.py
	Code to transform the 3 dimensional model so it can be read by cube robot project


QbiQ/
	Contains the code for the Cube-shaped robot project

Calibration/
	Images used in the camera calibration process

Images/
	Stereo image pairs used for 3 dimensional model generation


Generated Files:
PointClouds/
	3 d point clouds generated by the project
	Note: Point cloud reader such as Meshlab is required to view the point clouds 

QbiQ/*.txt
	Text files containing x, y, z coordinates of the transformed 3 d point clouds
